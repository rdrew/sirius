title: Navigation
---

Vanilla includes a simple navigation bar that you can add to the top of your 
sites.

The navigation items are collapsed behind a "Menu" link in small screens and 
displayed horizontally on larger screens.

Note: You can constrain the width of the navigation to match the 
`$grid-max-width` by placing everything inside the header element within a 
`.row` wrapper.
