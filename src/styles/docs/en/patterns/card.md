# Card

There are two card styles available to use in Vanilla.

A card will expand to fill the full width of its parent container.

All card styles, but in particular the highlighted card, should be used sparingly.

## Basic card

The purpose of the basic card is to display information, without user interaction.

## Highlighted card

The highlighted card should be used when you can interact with the content.
